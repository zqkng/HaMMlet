or who is he so fond will be the tomb, of his self-love to stop posterity? thou art thy mother's glass and she in thee calls back the lovely april of her prime, so thou through windows of thine age shalt see, despite of wrinkles this thy golden time. but if thou live remembered not to be, die single and thine image dies with thee.\", \"unthrifty loveliness why dost thou spend, upon thy self thy beauty's legacy?

yet be blamed, if thou thy self deceivest by wilful taste of what thy self refusest. i do forgive thy robbery gentle thief although thou steal thee all my poverty: and yet love knows it is a greater

second life on second head, ere beauty's dead fleece made another gay: in him those holy antique hours are seen, without all ornament, it self and true, making no summer of another's green, robbing no

with my lays, as philomel in summer's front doth sing, and stops her pipe in growth of riper days: not that the summer is less pleasant now than when her mournful hymns did hush the night, but that

most balmy time, my love looks fresh, and death to me subscribes, since spite of him i'll live in this poor rhyme, while he insults o'er dull and speechless tribes. and thou in this shalt find thy monument, when tyrants' crests and tombs of brass are spent.\", \"what's in the brain that ink may character, which hath not figured to thee my true spirit, what's new to speak, what now to register,

hallowed thy fair name. so that eternal love in love's fresh case, weighs not the dust and injury of age, nor gives to necessary wrinkles place, but makes antiquity for aye his page, finding the first conceit of love there bred, where time and outward form would show it dead.\", 'o never say that i was false of heart, though absence seemed my flame to qualify, as easy might i from my self depart,

water for my stain, never believe though in my nature reigned, all frailties that besiege all kinds of blood, that it could so preposterously be stained, to leave for nothing all thy sum of good: for

aspect. but when mine eyes i thereunto direct, they idly back return to me again, and when i hope to see their true object, i find myself but fed with fancies vain. cease then mine eyes, to seek herself to see, and let my thoughts behold herself in me.', \"men call you fair, and you do credit it, for that yourself ye daily such do see: but the true fair, that is the gentle wit, and virtuous

ensue. that is true beauty: that doth argue you to be divine and born of heavenly seed: deriv'd from that fair spirit, from whom all true and perfect beauty did at first proceed. he only fair, and

appears, or in her eyes the fire of love does spark. fair when her breast like a rich-laden bark, with precious merchandise she forth doth lay: fair when that cloud of pride, which oft doth dark her goodly light with smiles she drives away. but fairest she, when so she doth display, the gate with pearls and rubies richly dight: through which her words so wise do make their way to bear the message

have enchased your glorious name in golden monument. but since ye deigned so goodly to relent to me your thrall, in whom is little worth, that little that i am, shall all be spent, in setting your immoral praises forth. whose lofty argument uplifting me, shall lift you up unto an high degree.', \"my hungry eyes, through greedy covetize, still to behold the object of their pain: with no contentment can themselves suffice. but having pine, and having not complain. for lacking it, they cannot life sustain, and seeing it, they gaze on it the more: in their amazement like narcissus vain whose eyes him starv'd: so plenty makes me poor. yet are mine eyes so filled with the store of that fair sight, that nothing else they brook: but loath the things which they did like before, and can no more endure on them to look. all this world's glory seemeth vain to me, and all their shows but shadows, saving she.\", \"let not one spark of filthy lustfull fire ne one light glance of sensual desire attempt to work her gentle mind's unrest. but pure affections bred in spotless breast, and modest thoughts breathed from well tempered sprites go visit her in her chaste bower of rest, accompanied with angelic delights. there fill yourself with those most joyous sights, the which myself could never yet attain: but speak no word to her of these sad plights, which her too constant stiffness doth constrain. only behold her rare perfection, and bless your fortune's fair election.\", 'the world that cannot deem of worthy things, when i do praise her, say i do but flatter: so does the cuckoo, when the mavis sings, begin his witless note apace to clatter. but they that skill not of so heavenly matter, all that they know not, envy or admire, rather than envy let them wonder at her, but not to deem of her desert aspire. deep in the closet of my parts entire, her worth is written with a golden quill: that me with heavenly fury doth inspire, and my glad mouth with her sweet praises fill. which when as fame in her shrill trump shall thunder let the world choose to envy or to wonder.', \"venemous tongue, tipped with vile adders' sting, of that self kind with which the furies fell their snaky heads do comb, from which a spring of poisoned words and spiteful speeches well. let all the plagues and horrid pains of hell, upon thee fall for thine accursed hire: that with false-forged lies, which thou didst tell, in my true love did stir up coals of ire, the sparks whereof let kindle thine own fire, and catching hold on thine own wicked head consume thee quite, that didst with guile conspire in my sweet peace such breaches to have bred. shame be thy meed, and mischief thy reward, due to thyself that it for me prepared.\", 'since i did leave the presence of my love, many long weary days have i outworn: and many nights, that slowly seemed to move their sad protract from evening until morn. for when as day the heaven doth adorn, i wish that night the noyous day would end: and when as night hath us of light forlorn, i wish that day would shortly reascend. thus i the time with expectation spend, and fain my grief with changes to beguile, that further seems his term still to extend, and maketh every minute seem a mile. so sorrow still doth seem too long to last, but joyous hours do fly away too fast.', \"since i have lacked the comfort of that light, the which was wont to lead my thoughts astray: i wander as in darkness of the night, afraid of every danger's least dismay. ne ought i see, though in the clearest day, when others gaze upon their shadows vain: but th'only image of that heavenly ray, whereof some glance doth in mine eye remain. of which beholding the idea plain, through contemplation of my purest part: with light thereof i do myself sustain, and thereon feed my love-afamished heart. but with such brightness whilst i fill my mind, i starve my body and mine eyes do blind.\", 'like as the culver on the bared bough, sits mourning for the absence of her mate, and in her songs sends many a wishful vow, for his return that seems to linger late. so i alone now left disconsolate, mourn to myself the absence of my love: and wandering here and there all desolate, seek with my plaints to match that mournful dove: ne joy of aught that under heaven doth hove, can comfort me, but her own joyous sight: whose sweet aspect both god and man can move, in her unspotted pleasauns to delight. dark is my day, while her fair light i miss, and dead my life that wants such lively bliss.']\n"
