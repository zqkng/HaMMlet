##### Put Trained Hidden Markov Models Here.


Each HMM must include (in Python pickle format):
    + Initial State Distribution Vector (*-INIT.p)
    + Transition Probability Matrix (*-TRANSITION.p)
    + Emission Probability Matrix (*-EMISSION.p)
    + Mapping of word tokens to observation indicies (*-TOKENS.p)

Trained HMM (with all of the above) can be produced by using `poemgen.py`.
